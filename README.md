# ReactJS Portfolio

### ***(Portfolio is still work-in-progress)***

This project represents a Proof of Concept about realizing a simple React application (with minimal configuration), without using tools like `create-react-app`.
It has been realized by using web application bundler [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)<br>
Thanks to [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages), it offers the possibility to deploy the web app, through dedicated npm script, on the corresponding [GitHub page](https://vpellegrino.github.io/reactjs-portfolio/#/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Launches the dependencies installation<br>

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run deploy`

Starting from the content in the `dist` folder, automatically produced by the `predeploy` command, it deploys this application on the [GitHub page](https://vpellegrino.github.io/reactjs-portfolio/#/)
